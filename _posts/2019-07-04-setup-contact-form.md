I thought it would be cool to give the opportunity to the random internet
user to [contact me](/contact) if they so wanted. Turns out it's pretty easy,
so here's a tutorial on how to set up a contact form on Jekyll using
[Formspree](https://formspree.io/).

## What's Formspree?

It's a HTML form generator, that transfers the form's answers to your
email address. Plus it's free and no registration is required.

There is also a paid plan for additional features, but until 50 messages
a month, I guess the free plan is enough for most uses.

## Basic setup

Formspree provides a [test environment](https://test.formspree.io/)
where you can tweak your HTML before including it on your website.

```html
<form method="POST" action="https://formspree.io/<YOUR_EMAIL_HERE>">
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your name">
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your message" rows="3">
  </textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
</form>
```

You simply have to include your contact email on line 1 
(`<YOUR_EMAIL_HERE>`), and the form works! 

{% include images.html file="formspree-test-form.png" 
  caption="You can test the form directly in Formspree's environment" 
  alt="Test your contact form" %}

*Note:* You'll have to first activate each domain you set up
your contact form on (through an activation link sent to the email address
provided), so it's no use adding your friend's email for a prank ðŸ˜‰

You can also customize the `placeholder` of your
input questions, or add any other question, like:

```html
<input type="text" name="subject" placeholder="Message's subject">
```

## Integration with Jekyll

You could now copy/paste the HTML code and include it any `.html` file of your
blog.

However, the best way to do that would be to insert this code into an
`_includes` file, and create a dedicated `_layouts`. This way, you'll be able
to edit the page with the contact form using a nice and clean Markdown! ðŸ’™

First, let's create a new layout in your `root/_layouts` folder and name 
it `contact.html`.

{% gist 838f4658b87635fca91333972b91f066 %}

You'll notice that this layout is based on the default `page.html` layout,
and this allows us to do the following: 

* Automatically use the title attribute to create a `<h1>`
* Type your content and it will appear before the contact form

*Note*: I'm using the Hydeout Jekyll template, which may have different layout
names than your own.

Then, we'll create the `contact-form.html` mentioned in the previous code 
excerpt. Place it in the `root/_includes` folder. This file will host the
HTML you generated through Formspree, which in this case, is:

```html
<form method="POST" action="https://formspree.io/<YOUR_EMAIL_HERE>">
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your name">
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your message" rows="3">
  </textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
</form>
```

You now have a working `contact` layout! ðŸŒˆ

To use it, create a new post, and insert `layout: contact` in the YAML front
matter. You can now type any Markdown content you want, and your text will be
displayed before your contact form!

## Final Adjustments

However, in my case, the `Your Message` (`textarea`) part was displayed poorly,
because the Hydeout template did not have any CSS for `textarea`.

I therefore had to create some styling in order to homogenize the form. I've
included the following SCSS in my `assets/css/main.scss`:

```scss
input[type="text"], input[type="email"], input[type="search"], 
input[type="submit"], button, textarea { 
  padding: 1em 1.5em; 
  border: 1px solid #e5e5e5; 
  border-radius: 300px; 
  margin-bottom: 1em; 
  font-family:  -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", 
                "Roboto", "Oxygen", "Ubuntu", "Cantarell", 
                "Fira Sans", "Droid Sans", "Helvetica Neue", 
                Arial, sans-serif; 
}

textarea { width: 73%;  resize: none; }
```

I've also added `rows="3"` in the `contact-form.html` in order to widen the 
text area. Bear in mind that all these changes are pretty specific to the
Hydeout template so you'll probably have to tweak your own CSS in order
to have a coherent style.

{% include images.html file="contact-form.png"
  caption="Example of contact form" alt="Here you go!" %}
