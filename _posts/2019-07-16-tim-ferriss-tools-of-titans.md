During my summer vacations, I've chosen to browse through the famous 
book **Tools of Titans**, by Tim Ferriss. At the beginning of the
book, Tim warns us that this book's content is not a one-fit-for-all:
everyone will pick out some details that speak to them more specifically. 

And unsurprisingly, I've found parts that I particularly enjoyed, which
resonated strangely with my own experiences. Other parts (especially
everything related to extreme strength) seemed pretty alien to me. 
Here's a list of things (in no particular order) that I hope to
remember from this book.

## Fasting and Chemotherapy

According to 
[Dominic d'Agostino](https://dominicdagostino.wordpress.com/), fasting before 
chemotherapy helps increase the body's response to cancer treatments.
Apparently, fasting stops rapidly dividing cells (ie. cancerous cells) and 
makes them selectively more vulnerable to radiation and chemotherapy.

Like most, I hope that this knowledge will never come in handy in my life, but
it's a cool piece of information.

## The Four Bullets to Dodge

If you're non-smoking and over 40 years old, there is a 70-80% chance you'll
die of one of the following:
* heart disease,
* cerebrovascular disease (eg. a stroke),
* cancer,
* neurodegenerative disease (like Alzheimer or Parkinson).

Therefore, according to [Peter Attia](https://peterattiamd.com/), if you want
to extend your lifespan, most of your efforts should be geared towards keeping
these 4 threats at bay.

## The Billionaire's Problem

> also a billionaire</cite>

That tweet seemed so true. Although I've never met a billionaire, I've had the 
chance to mix with millionaires (the next best thing). Over time, it grew 
harder to give them honest feedback when requested, because they had grown
accustomed to hearing that their ideas were fabulous. I think they 
started to believe it.

## Meditating for others

I've read somewhere that if you wish to convert money into happiness, you 
should buy someone a gift. The act of gift-giving generates in the giver
more happiness and for a longer time than buying something for yourself.

[Chade-Meng Tan](http://chademeng.com/) takes it even further, and suggest
this simple meditation called **loving-kindness**. The person meditating needs
to identify a person and just think "I wish for this person to be happy".
The entire exercise is this 5 seconds train of thoughts.

That's what makes it brilliant.  Everyone can spare 5 seconds to think
about someone else and wish them the best. And the simple act of wishing the 
best for someone else increases your own happiness. That probably is the best
deal ever: free happiness for a 5 seconds invisible action.
