I've recently reached the halfway-point in Launch School's Core Curriculum,
and thought it would be a great time to reflect on the road taken thus far.

Plus we're reaching the end of the year *and* the end of the decade, so 
looking back on your own path seems like the sensible thing to do.

<!-- Ideas:
- Long life on the plateau => timelog?
- Ruby Meetup and Dimelo
- Mentoring students
- Deep Sea Adventure
- Do things differently?
- Rabbit holes? -->

I'll start by stating the painful and obvious: reaching the halfway
point *sucks*.

Or, more precisely, realising that you have to do *again* the same amount of 
efforts is pretty disheartening.

Not that I didn't enjoy my studies with Launch School - quite the
opposite actually. I just can't push away that nasty voice telling me that
I'm not "a real Software Engineer" just yet. And as I'm now leaving
Ruby behind (but fear not, you'll always be in my heart!) for the tedious
world of CSS and JavaScript, I'm wondering whether I'll ever feel like
I am, in fact, a real Software Engineer.


Anyway, and on a lighter note - I'll try to account here for my experiences 
at Launch School so far, and hopefully help you through your own 
learning journey.
