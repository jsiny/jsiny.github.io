I recently took Launch School's first written exam (RB 109), that comes at the
end of the first course, RB 101, Programming Foundation.

This course is 
especially challenging because it forces us to simultaneously:
* learn to learn again,
* learn Ruby syntax,
* learn problem solving.

I thought it would be a good time to reflect on my study methods and the time
it took me to get there.
