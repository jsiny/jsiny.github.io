This [website](https://deep-sea-adventure.herokuapp.com/) is a **scoring tool**
dedicated to the board game
[Deep Sea Adventure](https://oinkgms.com/en/deep-sea-adventure) edited by
[Oink Games](https://oinkgms.com/en/).

Its goal is to provide players a **reliable way to compute the oxygen decrease**
during a round. It's meant to be used side by side with the board game,
either on a mobile or computer.

After 6 months of learning, this project is my **first** big, entirely personal
project, and I'm very proud of it.

## Tech Stack

This tool has been developed in **Ruby**, as I've spent the past months
learning programming through that language. I've applied an object-oriented
design as it felt natural to segment the various elements into objects with
an interface (`Players`, `Round`, etc.)

I've chosen to develop the website through the light-weight, Ruby 
domain-specific language **Sinatra**. Even though I've previously worked with
Ruby on Rails, I preferred using a lighter library rather than a comprehensive
framework that may hide away the complexity of web applications.

```ruby
# Homepage
get '/' do
  erb :home
end
```

For instance, this Sinatra code snippet means that a `GET` request to the
homepage (`/`) will trigger the loading of the ERB (embedded Ruby) template
`home.erb`.

As the project grew in complexity, I've added a comprehensive test suite (with
**Minitest**), in order to be able to safely refactor and prevent regressions.

  caption="All green! ðŸ’š" 
  alt="Minitest" %}

Additionally, I taught myself to work with **Bootstrap** for this project.
Being a complete beginner in front-end development, with no knowledge of
JavaScript and only the very basics of CSS, this proved to be quite
challenging.

However, I'm happy I went through that struggle because Bootstrap helped me
build a smooth and user-friendly application (both on desktop *and* mobile).

I've deployed the application on **Heroku**, mostly because it's a 
free hosting service. (The app is hosted onto an EU server, so US-based
users might encounter some latency.)

Finally, I also took the opportunity to learn about **Travis CI** and set up
my first continuous integration and automatic deployment, through
`Github > Travis CI > Heroku`. As I was working alone on this project,
this configuration probably is a luxury, but it's never too early to learn
the best practices.

## Challenges

Through this project, I've faced two main challenges:
* I had to learn the basics of front-end and Bootstrap to go through it
* I wanted to build an application *with no database and log-in system* so
instead, I extensively used session storage
