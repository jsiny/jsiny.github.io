## üíº Professional Experiences

### 2015 - 2019: From intern to General manager in Selectra, Paris (France)

[Selectra](https://selectra.info) is a French startup specialised in helping private 
consumers save on their domestic bills (energy, internet, mobile plan,
insurance, bank accounts). Selectra is notably famous for
[its innovative web applications](https://comparateur.selectra.info),
some I helped creating. 

In 2019, Selectra was active in the following markets: France, Spain, 
Portugal, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Turkey
and Japan. Its growth had been awarded by a 303th position in the 
[Financial Times 1000](https://ig.ft.com/ft-1000/) in 2017 (Europe's fastest 
growing companies), and  Selectra reached its 1000th employee in 2019.

I held various positions in the company. I first arrived as an **intern** in 
2015, was hired a few months later to work as an **internal consultant**, 
softly evolved towards management, and was promoted Selectra France's
**general manager** in 2018. I was 24 at that time, and the news that a
somewhat reknown startup was promoting youngsters 
[made quite some noise](https://start.lesechos.fr/startups/actu-startups/25-ans-juliette-sinibardy-est-nommee-dg-de-selectra-france-13576.php). 

I was extremely honored to manage a **350 people** company (with 
a turnover of **‚Ç¨35 million**). I particularly enjoyed hiring new talents and
making sure they would fit right in! I was also pretty involved in our tech 
department, and would like to highlight here some tech-related achievements 
I'm particularly proud of:
- Structuring the tech team, which (during my time) grew from 2 developers
to 20 people working in various positions (PHP, Drupal, JavaScript, SysAdmin, 
Project Managers, Service Engineers)
- Designing a core business app, dedicated to easy subscription of energy 
contracts, now used by Selectra sales persons and internet users alike.
- Transitioning from traditional project management towards the 
agile methodology (Scrum), thus drastically reducing our time to market
and centering our products onto minimum viable versions.


## üéì Education

### 2019 - Onwards: Launch School (Online)

I'm currently enrolled into [Launch School](https://launchschool.com), an online
school dedicated to teaching mastery in web programming (no less!)

The program covers the fundamentals of programming in about 1800 hours
(far from the *"Become a developer in 2 months"* bootcamp fallacy). The
curriculum focuses on Ruby (back) and JavaScript (front).

### 2011 - 2017: Sciences Po, Paris (France)

Right after high school, I got into the Paris Institute of Political
Studies, or "[Sciences Po](https://sciencespo.fr)" for short. I was mostly
interested by their prestigious programs in Social sciences, and enrolled into
a Bachelor in Economics (2011 - 2014) and into their Master in **Economics and 
Business** (2014 - 2017), which I graduated *Summa cum laude*.

### 2013 - 2014: Copenhagen Business School, Copenhagen (Denmark)

I had the opportunity to study abroad for a year, and chose to join 
[CBS](https://www.cbs.dk/en). Apart from studying (when I didn't know what 
else to do), I discovered the Nordic culture, Danish, and 
[kanelsnegle üç™](https://scandinaviadreaming.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/les-kanelsgnels-danois.jpg?w=660).
