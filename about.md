# Hello internet

## A few words about me

I'm a 25 year old aspiring web programmer. My name is **Juliette Sinibardy**, or 
Juliette Siny for short. I'm very fond of my final `y` so please don't 
leave it out.

Apart from my `y`, I like: photography, desserts and my cat.

## Isn't 25 a bit old to learn programming?

First, this side comment is a tad ageist, and second... Maybe? But then: 
who cares? There will always be a genius 12 year old somewhere to make me
question my inner worth.

## If you're a late bloomer, what have you done before?

Before my first "Hello World" website, I graduated with a Master's degree in
Economics and worked for 4 years in a French startup called 
[Selectra](selectra.info). I entered as the intern of a 200 people startup and 
left as the General manager of a 1000 employee company. Most people told me I 
was crazy to leave such a promising career  (they were probably right) 
...but here I am. 

## So... Are you learning programming by yourself?

Not really! After browsing through free programming courses, I found
[Launch School](launchschool.com) and enrolled in their program. This is a 
self-paced online school, so I'm somewhat learning by myself, but
through a logically ordered course.

I am currently working on the Ruby courses (which may sound dumb as 
[the current trendy language is JavaScript](https://medium.com/constructorlabs/ruby-vs-javascript-as-a-first-programming-language-2f2c944629fe))
and enjoying my life on the plateau.

## Cool, and what will you post here?

In my blog, you'll find articles about my daily struggles, how-to guides and
my portfolio of creations.

Even though I'm a native French speaker (currently living in France), most
(if not all) of my articles will be written in English, as English is the 
*lingua franca* of the tech world.

**Happy browsing!**
