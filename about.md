## Hello internet ðŸ‘‹

### A few words about me

I'm a 25 year old aspiring web programmer. My name is **Juliette Sinibardy**, or 
Juliette Siny for short. I'm very fond of my final `y` so please don't 
leave it out.

Apart from my `y`, I like: photography, desserts and my cat.

### Isn't 25 a bit old to learn programming?

First, this side comment is a tad ageist, and second... Maybe? But then: 
who cares? There will always be a genius 12 year old somewhere to make me
question my inner worth.

### If you're a late bloomer, what have you done before?

Before my first "Hello World" website, I graduated with a Master's degree in
Economics and worked for 4 years in a French startup called 
[Selectra](https://selectra.info) (more on that [here](/work)).

I entered as the intern of a 200 people startup and left as the General 
manager of a 1000 employee company. It was an humbling experience, but I'm 
glad to be able to *build stuff* with my own hands now.

### Are you learning programming by yourself?

Not really! After browsing through free programming courses, I found
[Launch School](https://launchschool.com) and enrolled in their program. This is a 
self-paced online school, so I'm somewhat learning by myself, but
through a logically ordered course.

I am currently working on the Ruby courses (after quite some thought as
[the current trendy language is JavaScript](https://medium.com/constructorlabs/ruby-vs-javascript-as-a-first-programming-language-2f2c944629fe))
and enjoying my life on the plateau.

### Cool, and what will you post here?

In my blog, you'll find articles about my daily struggles, how-to guides and
my portfolio of creations.

Even though I'm a native French speaker (currently living in France), most
(if not all) of my articles will be written in English, as English is the 
*lingua franca* of the tech world.

**Happy browsing!** ðŸ™Œ
