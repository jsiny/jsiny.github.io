  &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs alive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a sleepless night, several gallons of tears and dozens of hours spent 
browsing stackoverflow, my new blog is now live üåà&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not exactly new to blogging, but this is the first time I‚Äôm wandering away
from Wordpress. Oh boy, that was &lt;em&gt;difficult&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-would-i-do-that&quot;&gt;Why would I do that?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all came down to one of my dearest colleague ranting about Medium.
I had just wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@juju.siny/my-study-habits-ae5c778b5a14&quot;&gt;my first Medium post&lt;/a&gt;
(and was pretty pleased with myself), when he told me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I like your post, but why would anyone pay to read blog posts that could be 
found somewhere else, without any added value to the reading experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, he‚Äôs a grumpy old man, but as I‚Äôm not too fond of the new 
Medium paywall either, I thought he had a point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I had wanted to create a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù blog for ages, and thought that
my 3 months of consecutive programming might be enough to create a ‚Äúreal‚Äù
blog, away from traditional CMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have bitten more than I could chew. No regrets though, 
the learning experience was well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-did-it&quot;&gt;How I did it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I tried to set up a blog through &lt;a href=&quot;https://gohugo.io/&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;,
because I had read somewhere that their loading time was exceptionally fast,
and (let‚Äôs be honest) because their templates were stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I failed miserably. It seemed that whatever I did, my Cloud9
environment refused to accept &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ego a little bruised, I looked up alternatives and found another
static-site generator: &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good news: it‚Äôs in Ruby! I can finally grasp what‚Äôs happening 
under the hood üôå Hugo, on the other hand, is written in Go and therefore
looks like gibberish to the beginner that I am.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bad news: Jekyll seems a bit ouf of fashion, and most resources about
it are somewhat dated. Most templates or blog posts are based on earlier
versions of Jekyll, therefore I encountered a couple of version issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difficulty arose when I tried escaping the dry 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyll.github.io/minima/&quot;&gt;Minima&lt;/a&gt; default Jekyll template.
Apparently, there are some layout naming issues between templates
and Github pages that made transitions difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit lost, I tweaked my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_layout&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes&lt;/code&gt; a lot, heavily drawing
inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/d0n601/ryankozak.com&quot;&gt;Ryan Kozak&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ltebben/ltebben.github.io&quot;&gt;Laura Tebben&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs 
public repositories (thank god for public repositories), and finally
managed to install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout&quot;&gt;Hydeout&lt;/a&gt; theme üçæ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next challenge will be to buy and set up my first domain (bye bye ugly
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;github.io&lt;/code&gt; domain name, you will be missed) ‚Ä¶but this is for another day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Blogging" /><category term="Jekyll" /><category term="Medium" /><summary type="html">It‚Äôs alive!</summary></entry></feed>
